## 1. Brief
Quick project for KPN assesment, I wanted to implement redux, but I remember what a long process that was from my react native app developing days, so I chose to leave that for later since I am strapped for time during exam week. 

You can run it in the root directory with: 
```
npm start 
```
or
```
yarn start
````


## 2. Potential Changes
- For the View/Edit button, I would like to add a card that would pop up making it easier for the user to make changes rather than scrolling
- I would add filter tags to the table to allow for filtering by attributes
- Add a mobile mode as the table doesn't scale well for narrow screens
- Implement Redux: this would be the last step

## Dependencies
There are some extra dependencies that can be removed, but are present due to me experimenting.

Running `npm install` or `yarn install` would install everything needed.
